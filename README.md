# crab-tracker

This repository contains hardware designs and software to create prototypes of a low-cost, customizable ultrasonic telemetryt system that can be used to relocate crabs or other things in shallow (<30m) aquatic environments. The basic design uses piezoelectric ceramic crystals embedded in each emitter to send short pulses of sound. These pulses of sound are received by four hydrophones - the time delay between arrival of the sound pulses at each of the different hydrophones can be used to calculate the direction from the receiver array to the emitter.

Full technical details are available in WWU's CEDAR archive here ______.

Arduino-style code to program the emitters is available in the ___ directory

Arduino-style code to configuer the GPX2 timing chip is available in the ___ directory.

Various testing code for individual components are available in the ___ directory.

Circuit board designs and parts lists are available in the Hardware directory.



Orginally a fork of https://github.com/cabeese/crab-tracker/, this repository is intended as supplemental information for Barnes 2019 ___. This repository adds hardware schematics, fabrication details, and mathematical treatment to the original repository.
